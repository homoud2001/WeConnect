# WeConnect
In WeConnect, you can meet new people with the same interests as you! You can chat anonymously before befriending them.
You can also block them if they may make you feel uncomfortable. You will have to take precautions to your new friend. They may not even
be your friend. You will have the ability to share your story to the website. There are five stages in your friendship here in WeConnect.
First there is the search for a friend. Then there is the Q&A. Next is the anonymous chat. After that is the non- anonymous chat. Just don't share private info. If you are meeting
them in real life and made the choice, take a friend to the location just in case things went bad. Finally, you get the choice to share your story or not.
NOTE: THIS IS NOT A DATING WEBSITE JUST A FRIENDING WEBSITE!!! YOU ALSO CAN REPORT SOMEONE OR BLOCK THEM AS I SAID EARLIER! 
Thank you for choosing WeConnect
